# Add Packet Feature Development Log

## Conversation Summary
This document captures the full agent interaction during the development of the "add packet" feature for the PCAP Hex Editor.

## Feature Requirements
- Add new feature to packet list panel
- Press 'a' key to generate new packet
- Use SCAPY with default content: Ethernet header + IPv4 layer + UDP layer
- Append new packet after currently highlighted packet
- Set timestamp as middle value between current and next packet timestamp

## Development Process

### 1. Initial Setup
- Created new git branch: `add-packet-feature`
- Switched to the new branch for feature development

### 2. Code Analysis
- Examined `packet_list_panel.py` to understand current structure
- Reviewed `main.py` to understand packet management and panel integration
- Analyzed `focusable_panel.py` for key event handling

### 3. Implementation Changes

#### Packet List Panel (`pcap_hex_editor/panels/packet_list_panel.py`)
- Added Scapy imports: `Ether`, `IP`, `UDP`, `Raw`
- Enhanced constructor to accept `on_packet_add_callback`
- Updated help text to show "a: add packet" instruction
- Added key handler for 'a' key
- Implemented `add_new_packet()` method with:
  - Packet generation using Scapy layers
  - Smart timestamp calculation
  - Packet insertion logic
  - Panel update and selection

#### Main Application (`pcap_hex_editor/main.py`)
- Added `on_packet_add` callback to PacketListPanel
- Implemented `on_packet_add()` method for handling new packets
- Added panel synchronization and status feedback

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- **Smart Timestamping**: Calculates middle timestamp between packets
- **Default Packet Structure**: Ethernet + IPv4 + UDP + raw data
- **Automatic Selection**: New packet immediately selected and displayed
- **Status Feedback**: Confirmation message in status bar
- **Panel Synchronization**: All panels update with new packet

### 5. Git Workflow
- Committed changes with descriptive message
- Pulled latest changes from main branch
- Feature successfully integrated

## Technical Details

### Packet Generation
```python
new_packet = Ether() / IP() / UDP() / Raw(load=b"New packet data")
```

### Timestamp Calculation
```python
if self.selected_index < len(self.packets) - 1:
    next_ts = getattr(self.packets[self.selected_index + 1], 'time', current_ts + 1)
    new_ts = (current_ts + next_ts) / 2
else:
    new_ts = current_ts + 1
```

### Key Event Handling
```python
elif event.key == "a":
    self.add_new_packet()
```

## Files Modified
1. `pcap_hex_editor/panels/packet_list_panel.py` - Main feature implementation
2. `pcap_hex_editor/main.py` - Integration and callback handling

## Testing Notes
- Feature ready for testing
- Press 'a' when packet list panel is focused
- New packet will be inserted and automatically selected
- All panels will update to show the new packet

## Future Enhancements
- Customizable packet templates
- Batch packet insertion
- Undo/redo functionality for packet operations
